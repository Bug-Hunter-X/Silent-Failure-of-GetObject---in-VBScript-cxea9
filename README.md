This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript involving the `GetObject()` function.  The `GetObject()` function, while useful for accessing COM objects, can fail silently if the specified object is unavailable. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-trace errors in larger scripts. The `bug.vbs` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version that explicitly checks for errors using the `Is Nothing` comparison.  The improved solution ensures robust error handling and prevents potential application crashes or data corruption.
